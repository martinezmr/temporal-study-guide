# 30 Days of Temporal (Python) — Network Automation Track

A self-paced, 30-day path from "I've run a few workflows" to a production-shaped
**`NetworkComplianceOrchestrator`**: a long-running entity workflow that compares
intent (Nautobot) with state (4 Arista cEOS nodes) and launches
`ConfigComplianceWorkflow` or `DeviceUpgradeWorkflow` when they drift — with Nexus
across team boundaries, AI where it helps, and workers ready for OpenShift + CI/CD.

Each day builds on the code from the day before, in this one repo.

## How to use it

1. Do the [lab setup](docs/lab-setup.md) once (about 30 minutes).
2. Each day, open that day's `README.md` and work through **Learn → Build → Break it → Done when**.
3. Write one line per day in [`LEARNING.md`](LEARNING.md): what surprised you.
4. Commit at the end of each day (`git commit -m "day 07: parallel backup"`), so you can diff your progress.

Budget 60–90 minutes a day. Weeks 1–2 move fast if you already know the basics.

## Where to run it

| Environment | Good for | Not good for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Your Mac** (Podman/OrbStack + containerlab + Nautobot) | Everything. This is the primary lab. | — |
| **GitHub Codespaces** ([details](docs/codespaces.md)) | Any day marked ☁️ below: Temporal server, UI, mocked device activities, Nexus, AI | Talking to your cEOS lab or Nautobot on your Mac |

## Solutions

Worked solutions for every day live in [`solutions/`](solutions/README.md): one folder per day with a `SOLUTION.md`, runnable code, and tests. By default they run against an in-memory **mock lab** (your four device names, your topology, two built-in drifts), so you can check your work without containerlab or Nautobot. Set `DEVICE_MODE=live` to use the real lab.

```bash
uv run pytest solutions/tests -q
uv run python -m solutions.day14.run worker   # then: uv run python -m solutions.day14.run start
```

```

## Versions assumed

- Temporal Python SDK `temporalio` 1.34 (released 30 Sep 2026)
- Python 3.13 (3.14 works for Weeks 1–3; some AI libraries may lag)
- Temporal CLI dev server with `--db-filename` for persistence

See [docs/feature-checklist.md](docs/feature-checklist.md) for everything covered and what to explore after Day 30.
